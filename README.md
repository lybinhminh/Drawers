# Drawers
Java Map&lt;T1,T2> has the function containsKey(T1 k), however, it returns whether there is the address of the k in the map, not if there is a key with the same value as k in the map. Drawers act just like map, but its containsKey(T1 k) func works by comparing value of k to the keys in it.
