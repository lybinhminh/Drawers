# Drawers
Java Map&lt;T1,T2> has the function containsKey(T1 k), however, it returns whether there is the address of the k in the map, not if there is a key with the same value as k in the map. Drawers act just like map, but its containsKey(T1 k) func works by comparing value of k to the keys in it.
How to use?
Create inside your project a java class and copy the code of Drawers in, then you have it installed and can be used. Remember to define the package where the Drawers class file is in.
Origin of Drawers.
I'm a boy who does not know any about coding, I don't learn programming at school or follow a course, instead, I look at others' code and read document to understand what does it do and how to use it, after years, I have got a decent amount of knowledge about C and Java language, though, I still don't consider me as a coder. Well, I made Drawers while I was working on a Minecraft server plugin, I ran into problems with Map that I mentioned in the difference between Drawers and Map, that's the reason I coded Drawers. Because I'm lazy and not a senior nor even junior programmer, so it's really simple, you can extend it to fit your usage.
Thanks.
